Welcome to the **Community Hydrofabric** repository! This space is dedicated to tracking and managing errors related to map items within the hydrofabric, such as **hydrolocations**, **topology fixes**, and other geospatial issues.

We leverage **GitHub issue templates** to standardize the reporting process to automate validation and generate valuable CSV reports for easy tracking and analysis.

## üåü Introduction

This repository serves as a central hub for users to report errors in hydrofabric map data. This includes issues like:

*   Incorrect **hydrolocations** (POI assignments)
*   **Topology** problems (missing/incorrect flowpaths)
*   **Flowpath** and **divide** errors (merging, removing, re-identifying)

By using predefined **issue templates**, we ensure that all necessary information is collected in a consistent and structured format, Therefore streamlining the process of managing and resolving reported errors.

## ‚ùì How to Report an Issue

Follow these simple steps to report an issue effectively using the appropriate template:

### Selecting the Right Template

1.  Navigate to the **"Issues"** tab in this repository.
2.  Click the **"New issue"** button.
3.  Browse the available templates and choose the one that best matches the type of issue you want to report (e.g., `Map Error: Hydrolocations` or `Map Error: Topo Fixes`).
4.  Click on the selected template.

### Filling Out the Template

1.  **Required Fields:** Pay close attention to fields marked with an asterisk (\*). Ensure all required information is accurately provided (**except for title that should not be changed**).
2.  **Coordinates:** If providing coordinates, enter **numerical values** for `Latitude` and `Longitude`, and the **numerical EPSG code** (e.g., `5070` for NAD83 / Conus Albers).
3.  **New ID / IDs to Merge/Union:** For relevant issue types, follow the instructions carefully regarding providing a `New ID` or a `comma-separated list` of IDs.
4.  **Description:** Provide a clear and concise description of the issue. Include context, observed behavior, and expected behavior. You can also **upload images** directly into the description field by dragging and dropping them.
5.  **Hydrofabric Version:** Select the version of the hydrofabric you are working with from the dropdown.

### Tips for Reporting

*   ‚úÖ Use the provided placeholders and examples in the template as guides.
*   ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è If you‚Äôre unsure about a specific field, refer to the description provided within the template itself or add a note in the main description.
*   üìç For coordinates, double-check the `EPSG code` to avoid validation errors.
*   üì∏ Screenshots or maps highlighting the issue location are highly encouraged and can be easily added to the description.

## ü§ñ Validation and Automation

Our workflow is designed to help ensure data quality and streamline processing:

*   **Automatic Validation:** When you submit or edit an issue, a GitHub Action is triggered to automatically validate the input based on the specific issue type and the data you've entered.
    *   *Example:* If you select `"Add a hydrolocation feature"` in the Hydrolocations template, the action verifies that `Latitude`, `Longitude`, and `EPSG Code` are provided.
    *   *Example:* If you select `"Not indexed to the right flowpath"`, the action checks that a `New ID` is present.
*   **Feedback:** If the validation fails due to missing required fields or incorrect formatting, the GitHub Action will automatically post a **comment** on the issue, clearly indicating what needs to be corrected.
