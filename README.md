# üèûÔ∏è Welcome to the Community Hydrofabric Issue Tracker!

This repository is the central hub for reporting, tracking, and managing issues related to the **Next Generation Water Resources Modeling Framework Hydrofabric**. We focus on geospatial data quality, network connectivity, and feature accuracy.

To ensure consistency and enable automation, we use **GitHub Issue Templates**. These templates guide you through providing all necessary information, which in turn helps us validate submissions and generate useful reports for the Hydrofabric team.

## üåü Introduction

This repository is designed for the community to report specific geospatial issues within the Hydrofabric, including:

*   Incorrect or missing **flowpaths** and their connectivity.
*   Problems with **catchment divides** (e.g., incorrect IDs, necessary merges).
*   Issues with **hydrolocations** (Points of Interest, POIs) such as incorrect indexing to flowpaths or inaccurate coordinates.
*   Proposals for integrating **large external datasets**.

By using our structured issue templates, you help us gather precise information, which facilitates automated validation and allows the Hydrofabric team to efficiently address and integrate your feedback.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1.  **Report an Issue:** You select an appropriate template and fill in the required details.
2.  **Automatic Title Update:** The issue title will be automatically updated based on the primary identifier you provide.
3.  **Validation:** A GitHub Actions workflow automatically checks your submission for completeness based on the template's requirements. If issues are found, a comment is added to your issue.

---

## üìç Identifying Features

To report issues accurately, you'll often need to identify specific hydrofabric features. Please use the official **[Hydrofabric Viewer Map](https://spatial.dev.water.noaa.gov/view/hydrofabric)** to find:

*   **Item Identifiers (IDs)** for flowpaths or divides.
*   **Topology toids** (often the same as the item identifier for flowpaths).
*   **POI Identifiers** for hydrolocations.
*   **VPUs** (Vector Processing Units) where features are located.

---

## üìù Issue Types & Templates

We offer **eight** distinct issue templates to cover various scenarios. Please choose the one that best fits your issue.

### üó∫Ô∏è Flowpaths: Topo Fixes

*   **Purpose:** Report general **topology-related fixes** for flowpaths. This includes issues like missing connections, incorrect flow direction, or other structural problems not covered by specific merge/remove templates.
*   **Template:** [`01-topo-fixes.yml`](https://github.com/lynker-spatial/Community_Hydrofabric/issues/new?template=01-topo-fixes.yml)

### ‚ùå Flowpaths: Remove Flowpaths

*   **Purpose:** Request the **removal of specific flowpaths** that are erroneous, redundant, or no longer representative.

## ‚ùì How to Report an Issue

Follow these simple steps to report an issue effectively using the appropriate template:

### Selecting the Right Template

1.  Navigate to the **"Issues"** tab in this repository.
2.  Click the **"New issue"** button.
3.  Browse the available templates and choose the one that best matches the type of issue you want to report (e.g., `Flowpaths: Merge Flowpaths` or `Divides: Reid Divide`).
4.  The word before the colon sign represents the the target layer name, and words that are after represent the issue type. Click on the selected template.

### Filling Out the Template

1.  **Title:** For most templates, the title includes a placeholder like `<item-identifier>` or `<brief-description>`. **Do not manually change this part of the title.** It will be automatically updated by our system based on the first relevant identifier you provide in the form.
2.  **Required Fields:** Fields marked with a red asterisk (`*`) are mandatory. Please fill them out accurately.
3.  **Hydrofabric Version:** Always select the version of the Hydrofabric your issue pertains to.
4.  **Report Mode:** Many templates offer a "Report Mode" (e.g., "Report a single instance" vs. "Report many instances").
    *   Choose **"Report a single instance"** if your issue pertains to one specific item or operation.
    *   Choose **"Report many instances"** (or similar wording) if you have a list of items/operations of the same type. This allows you to paste data in columns (i.e., from an excel sheet but not including the header).
5.  **Identifiers & Coordinates:**
    *   Provide numerical IDs as requested.
    *   For coordinates (`Latitude`, `Longitude`) any coordinate system is accepted as long as a EPSG code is provided per each item. Provide the numerical `EPSG Code` for the coordinates (e.g., `4326` for WGS84, `5070` for NAD83/Conus Albers).
6.  **Descriptions:** Be as clear and concise as possible.
    *   Explain the problem and why it's an issue.
    *   Describe the expected correct state if known.
    *   You can **drag and drop images or files** directly into the description text areas to provide visual context. This is highly encouraged!

### Multi-Instance Reporting

When a template's "Report Mode" is set to "Report many instances (paste columns of data)" or similar:

*   For fields like `Item Identifier(s)`, `VPU(s)`, `New Latitude(s)`, etc., you can paste multiple lines of data, typically one entry per line.
*   **Ensure the number of lines corresponds across related fields** (e.g., if you list 5 Item Identifiers, you should provide 5 corresponding VPUs, as specified in the field description).

### Tips for Reporting

*   ‚úÖ **Be Specific:** The more precise your information, the easier it is to address the issue.
*   üó∫Ô∏è **Use the Map:** Refer to the [Hydrofabric Viewer Map](https://spatial.dev.water.noaa.gov/view/hydrofabric) to get accurate IDs and VPUs.
*   üì∏ **Screenshots are Great:** A picture is worth a thousand words. Highlight the problematic area.
*   ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **If Unsure:** If you're uncertain about a field, provide your best guess and explain any uncertainties in the description.
*   üö´ **One Issue per Report (Generally):** Unless using the "Report many instances" feature for similar items, please create separate GitHub issues for distinct problems.
---

## ü§ñ Automation & Validation

To ensure data quality and streamline our processes:

1.  **Automatic Title Update:** Upon issue creation or edit, a GitHub Action updates the issue title using the primary identifier you provided (e.g., `<item-identifier>`).
2.  **Input Validation:** Another GitHub Action automatically validates your submission based on the template's requirements.
    *   *Example (Hydrolocation Additions):* If you specify an issue with indexing, it checks if you've provided the "New Correct Flowpath ID."
    *   *Example (Hydrolocation Geometry Cleanup - Coordinates): It verifies provided "Latitude(s)", "Longitude(s)", and "EPSG Code(s)" are valid using coordinate transformation.
3.  **Automated Feedback:** If validation fails (e.g., a required field is missing for the chosen options), the GitHub Action will post a **comment on your issue**, outlining what needs to be corrected. Please address these comments to ensure your issue can be processed.

## üåê Additional Information

*   **Questions?** For general questions about the Hydrofabric, this issue reporting process, or if your issue doesn't fit any template, please [open a new general issue](https://github.com/lynker-spatial/Community_Hydrofabric/issues/new) (you can choose to open a blank issue if no general template is suitable) or contact the developers.
